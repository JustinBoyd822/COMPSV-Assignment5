Time and Space Analysis for problem 1:
- Best-case: O(n) - still need to count all elements
- Worst-case: O(n) - single pass through all n elements
- Average-case: O(n) - linear scan is required regardless
- Space complexity: O(k) where k is number of unique elements, worst case O(n) if all unique
- Why this approach? Hash map provides O(1) lookup/update for counting frequencies.
  Single-pass optimization tracks maximum while counting.
- Could it be optimized? Could use Counter from collections for cleaner code, but same O(n) complexity.

Time and Space Analysis for problem 4:
- When do resizes happen? When size equals capacity (at sizes 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...)
  This occurs log‚ÇÇ(n) times for n insertions.
- What is the worst-case for a single append? O(n) - when resize occurs, must copy all n elements
- What is the amortized time per append overall? O(1) amortized
  Proof: Resizes cost 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + n ‚âà 2n total operations for n inserts.
  So n appends cost approximately 3n operations total ‚Üí O(1) amortized per append.
- Space complexity: O(n) - array holds n elements with some unused capacity
- Why does doubling reduce the cost overall? Doubling means we resize only log(n) times instead 
  of n times (which would happen if we increased by a constant). The geometric series 
  1+2+4+...+n sums to approximately 2n, making the total cost linear rather than quadratic.
  Each doubling "pays forward" for many future insertions without resizing.
